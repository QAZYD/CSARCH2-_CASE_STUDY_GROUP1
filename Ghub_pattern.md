## 1. Introduction
  The target pc build is a budget build that will be used for light gaming with a resolution of 720p and it is also viable for general web browsing and watching videos. The build is constrait to small budget of 20,000Php which limits the options to pick from so before even starting the build compromise is an expected outcome for the build, cheaper parts will be used due to the fact that they are cheap and satisfy the requirements rather than an actual desired part.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
* CPU [Intel Core I3 14100F] - the CPU posseses a LGA17000 socket so we chose H610M-E M.2 V20 DDR4 MATX as our motherboard 
* CPU COOLER, stock cooler - due to budget constraints we cannot afford an after market CPU cooler since portions of the budget are better
                             spent elsewhere
* Motherboard - [H610M-E M.2 V20 DDR4 MATX LGA1700] - the motherboard matches the CPU socket and allows for ddr4 ram and mvme m.2 attachemt                    through its sockets
* RAM - [PATRIOT SIGNATURE LINE PREMIUM NON-RGB BLACK 8GBX1=8GB 3200MHZ DDR4] - the ram posses a DDR4 socket, it is the reason why it was              chosen, ram is also on the cheaper side due to budget constraints
* SSD - [LEXAR NM610 PRO NVME 500GB GEN 3] - posses a NVME M.2 form factor which is the SSD slot compatible with the motherboard, the SSD was  
        also chosen due to its cheap price so that we can follow the budget constraints.
* GPU - [ASUS GeForce® GT 730 2GB GDDR5 64-bit Graphics Card] - we were able to squeeze in a budget GPU to fulfill the light gaming                    requirement of the build, but due to the GPU being included in the build there were more comprises to be made to subvert the hefty             cost of the GPU, an additional reason why we picked this specific GPU is because it ha sufficient cooling and compared to otehr GPUs           in the current market this GPU has lower clock speed making it much cooler compared to other GPUs.
* PSU - [MSI MAG A500N-H 500W ATX TRUE RATED NON MODULAR POWER SUPPLY] - a comprimise that had to be made is the PSU, it does not have any             certifications like bronze or gold but it has enough wattage to cover the essential parts, namely the GPU and the CPU who are ussually         the ones that eat the most power
* Case and Case fans - the case and case fans are pretty cheap and were only chosen so that the whole build can be put in an appropriate                              container

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱20,000  
- **Final Total**: ₱19,915
- ✅ Within budget / ❌ Over budget  
- Notes on trade-offs (e.g., cheaper RAM, higher PSU wattage, no aftermarket cooler, etc.).

  From the cost and budget perspective, our findings for the international draft build using PCPartPicker, garnered around $344.91 (~ ₱19,       915), which served as our baseline estimate. However, there's a big transition when it comes to our local Manila build findings as the         prices were slightly higher with a total of ₱19,948 due to import costs, limited stocks, and vendor markups.

  This lead to making trade-offs in choosing the components such as opting for higher-wattage PSU for future GPU upgrades while limiting RAM     and SSD capacity to maintain affordability. From this, we learned that international builds appear cheaper while going for local introduces    challenges that changes the perspective of price. 

  The build itself is full of compromises due to the low budget but it will still perform at an acceptable level for the task required by the    specs

  Despite this, our final build remained within the assigned budget, by strategically selecting components that balanced performance and         practical cost for an entry-level GPU, a mid-range processor, and locally available storage options.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
one of the most glaring things we found out during the prototyping and creation of a pc build is the price in western markets, particullarly in the united states are much cheaper by atleast 10 - 30% when converted to ph pricing and because of this limitation most of the parts used in the local build are either dowgrades or substitutions of the orginal prototype build since if we tried to follow the build in pcbuilder we would be way over budget. Another thing to point out is that most of the parts that were used in our build during the prototype cannot be found here locally and due to that most of the parts used in the final build are different from the prototype. What we learned as a group is that system design has a lot of nuances, you can't just pick part a and part b and hope that these 2 parts will work seamlessly, maufactures and part creators have done their job to make sure their parts are streamlined so that it can be compatible with other hardware despite directly communicating with other players in the market, as long as these manufactures follow the standards of the industry their parts should work with most of the popular compoents. SInce the parts in pc building are numeroous it cannot be help that some parts will not work together either they are outdated, come from a different eco system, or just for some odd reason unforseen by part creators that their products won't work with one another. As users of these parts we can avoid getting wrong parts by doing our own research and/or use resources that allow us to prototype builds so that we are sure that the parts that we want to use are compatible with each other. Pre plannig your build is  a requirement if you do not wan't to waste time and money, pre planning allows you to find out what works and what does not work and can also allow you to properly budget your build.
